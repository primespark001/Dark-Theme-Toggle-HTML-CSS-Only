## ⚠️ Disclaimer
> This dark theme toggle is implemented using **only HTML and CSS**, without any JavaScript.
> 
> - The theme may not persist after refreshing or navigating away from the page.
> - Theme switching relies on form elements like checkboxes or radio buttons and CSS pseudo-classes (`:checked`), which may behave differently across browsers.
> - Some accessibility features or advanced functionality may be limited without JavaScript.
>
> For a more robust and dynamic theme-switching experience, a JavaScript-based solution is recommended.
